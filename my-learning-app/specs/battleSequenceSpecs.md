## Initial check
- is the reverse of treasure sequence
- show English word and guess 
- If user is correct they can try to catch wisp if not it runs

## Battle 
-maybe the battle can be like catching a wisp with a net

-and it can act like fishing games in mmo where you hold the spacebar and let go of it to stay out of the red zone of a bar

-stats can effect how fast the bar pulls left or right and how large the red zone is- like keeping the circle in the center while its dragging right and pressing spacebar pulls left
