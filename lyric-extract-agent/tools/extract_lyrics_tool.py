This is a sample lyric for {song_title}
These are the words that would appear in the song
The melody and rhythm guide these phrases

[Chorus]
This is the part that repeats
The most memorable section
Where the main message resides

[Verse 2]
The story continues here
With more details and imagery
Building upon the established theme

[Chorus]
This is the part that repeats
The most memorable section
Where the main message resides

[Bridge]
A different section with new ideas
Often with a key change or different rhythm
Creating contrast and interest

[Chorus]
This is the part that repeats
The most memorable section
Where the main message resides

[Outro]
The song winds down
Concluding thoughts and emotions
Leaving a lasting impression
