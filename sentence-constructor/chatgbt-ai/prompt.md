Okay, here's a spooky short story to help you learn some Salish! I've included some Salish words and phrases within the story, and I'll provide a vocabulary list afterward. Remember, Salish languages vary, so I'll stick to general terms where possible.

**The Whispering Woods**

Long ago, in a village nestled beside the ʔaʔkʷúŋ (deep) forest, lived a young woman named Selya. She was warned never to enter the forest alone after dark, for it was said that ɬq̓ʷúptən (spirits) dwelled there. But Selya was stubborn and curious.

One night, when the ɬúpsəm (moon) was full, Selya snuck into the woods. The trees seemed to ʔəskʷímt (watch) her, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching out. A cold wind whistled through the leaves, carrying whispers she couldn’t quite understand. Was it just the wind, or were the təmíxʷ (earth's beings) trying to communicate?

Deeper she went, until she came to a ʔáləxʷ (clearing) she had never seen before. In the center stood an ancient cedar tree, its trunk twisted and gnarled. Suddenly, she heard a voice, faint but clear, calling her name: "Selya… Selya…" It sounded like her dead grandmother, who had been laid to rest at the sc̓əẃc̓əm (burial grounds).

Fear gripped Selya's qʷáy̓qʷay̓ (heart), but she couldn’t move. The voice grew louder, and the shadows around the tree seemed to dance. She felt a cold hand on her shoulder, and turned to see nothing there. The whispering intensified, becoming a chorus of voices, all chanting her name.

She tried to run, but her feet felt rooted to the ground. The ancient cedar loomed over her. Just as she thought she would lose her mind, a flicker of fire appeared in the distance - someone approaching with a txʷəlqʷəlqs (torch). The light grew stronger, and the voices began to fade. The presence on her shoulder vanished.

It was her grandfather, who had sensed something amiss. He pulled her from the clearing and didn't stop until they had emerged from the ʔəsx̣ʷúʔm (edge) of the woods. Selya never entered the Whispering Woods again, forever haunted by the voices and the feeling of that cold hand. She learned that some places are best left undisturbed, and that the stories of the elders should always be heeded, for they speak of powers older and darker than our own. She always carried a t̓xʷɬqʷəlc (protection charm) after that.

**The Shadow That Follows**  

In the quiet village of spəq̓ʷə́ʔ (owl), there was an old tale about a figure that walked among the ʔəw̓təxʷ (trees) at night. They called it the ɬq̓ʷʕay̓mn (shadow one), a being that could only be seen from the corner of your ʔəsq̓ʷuʔ (eye).  

One cold evening, a young boy named Tāliq stayed out too late by the sxʷč̓up (river). The ʔəsw̓éʔ (wind) howled through the trees, and the full ɬúpsəm (moon) cast long shadows on the ground. Just as he turned to leave, he saw movement—something shifting just beyond his sight.  

His qʷáy̓qʷay̓ (heart) pounded as he walked faster, but the presence behind him kept pace. Each step he took, he heard an extra footprint—one that wasn’t his own. He whispered a silent prayer to the təmíxʷ (earth’s beings), hoping they would guide him safely home.  

As he reached the edge of the village, the presence suddenly stopped. Tāliq turned back and saw nothing but the dark outlines of the ʔəw̓təxʷ (trees). But as he stepped inside his ʔáləxʷ (home), he caught one last glimpse in the reflection of the window—two glowing eyes staring back at him from the woods.  

He never walked alone at night again.
